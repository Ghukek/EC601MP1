# Keys
You will need a Google API key, stored in a json file in the parent directory to this one (outside of the git path). Name it 'googlekeys.json'.
You will need Twitter API keys as well, modify the code of 'TweetAPI.py' and change the variables to include your own keys. You should also place this file in the parent directory.
